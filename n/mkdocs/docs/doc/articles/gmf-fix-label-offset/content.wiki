=GMF: Fix offset in external labels=

The default offset for external labels in GMF is 20pt which is a bit too far away for my taste. Also, it is hard-coded in the templates which means that it can only be changed by modifying the generated code directly - or modifying the templates. If you want to do the latter you need to:
* close Eclipse
* open the org.eclipse.gmf.codegen_xxx.jar plugin using a zip program (I use winrar)
* extract the template located in templates\impl\diagram\editparts\NodeEditPart.xpt
* open it with a text editor and go to line 347
* replace `new org.eclipse.draw2d.geometry.Dimension(-20, -20)` with the settings of your preference (I've changed it to `-5, -5`)
* put the template back in the jar
* start Eclipse (the `-clean` switch may help)

(This works with the GMF version that ships with the Ganymede modeling distribution)
