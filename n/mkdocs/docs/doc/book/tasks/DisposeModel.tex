\subsection{Model Disposal Tasks}

When a model is no longer required by tasks of the workflow, it can be disposed using the \emph{epsilon.disposeModel} task. The task provides the \emph{model} attribute that defines the name of the model to be disposed. Also, the attribute-less \emph{epsilon.disposeModels} task is provided that disposes all the models in the project model repository. This task is typically invoked when the model management part of the workflow has finished.
