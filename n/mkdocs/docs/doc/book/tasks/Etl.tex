\subsection{Model-to-Model Transformation Task}

The \emph{epsilon.etl} task executes an ETL module, defined using the \emph{src} attribute to transform between the models that are specified using the \emph{model} nested elements. In addition to the attributes defined by the ExecutableModuleTask, this task also provides the \emph{exportTransformationTrace} attribute that enables the developer to export the internal transformation trace to the project context. In this way this trace can be reused by subsequent tasks; for example another task can serialize it in the form of a separate traceability model.
