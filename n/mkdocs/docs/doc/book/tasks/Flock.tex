\subsection{Model Migration Task}
\label{sec:FlockTask}
To support model migration, \textit{FlockTask (epsilon.flock)} is provided for executing an Epsilon Flock module (Chapter~\ref{sec:Flock}). In addition to the attributes defined by \textit{ExecutableModuleTask}, \textit{FlockTask} also defines the following mandatory attributes:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{originalModel} : Specifies which of the currently loaded models should be used as the source of the model migration.
	\item \textit{migratedModel} : Specifies which of the currently loaded models should be used as the target of the model migration.
\end{itemize}
