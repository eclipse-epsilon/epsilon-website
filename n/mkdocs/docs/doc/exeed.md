# Exeed

**Ex**tended **E**MF **Ed**itor (Exeed) is an enhanced version of the built-in EMF reflective tree-based editor that enables developers to customize the labels and icons of model elements simply by attaching a few simple annotations to the respective EClasses in the Ecore metamodel. Exeed also supports setting the values of references using drag-and-drop instead of using the combo boxes in the properties view. In combination with [ModeLink](modelink.md), Exeed editors can be used to weave two models using a third *weaving model*.

## Features

- Customize the appearance of nodes in the reflective tree editor without generating a dedicated editor
- Specify the label and icon of each node using [EOL](eol.md)
- Labels and icons can reflect the status of an element (e.g. different icon depending on whether a property is true/false)
