                                     Since 1.4, these JARs are also available from Maven Central. For instance, to use the <code>epsilon-core</code> JAR from your <code>pom.xml</code>:
                                     <pre>&lt;dependencies&gt;
  ...
  &lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.eclipse.epsilon&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;epsilon-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;1.5.1&lt;/version&gt;
