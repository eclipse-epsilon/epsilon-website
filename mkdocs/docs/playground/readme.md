# Development Instructions

The Playground uses `webpack` for compiling dependencies and custom JavaScript into a single `bundle.js` file under `dist`, which is then used in `index.html`. To rebuild `bundle.js` you need to run the following commands:

- `npx webpack --watch --mode=development` for a development build (faster build, larger `bundle.js`)
- `npx webpack --mode=production` before you push to GitHub (slower build, smaller `bundle.js`)

## Testing

We use [Cypress](https://cypress.io) for automated testing. Tests are stored under the `cypress/e2e` folder. To run a single test, you need to use the following command:

- `npx cypress run --browser firefox --spec "cypress/e2e/eol.cy.js"`

To run all the end-to-end tests under `cypress/e2e`, you can use the following command:

- `npx cypress run --browser firefox --spec "cypress/e2e/*.cy.js"`

Note: When the browser is not set to `firefox`, tests in `download.cy.js` can be flaky.

### Disable Live Reloading

To speed up test execution, please disable live reloading by serving the website using the following command.

```
./serve.sh --no-livereload
```
